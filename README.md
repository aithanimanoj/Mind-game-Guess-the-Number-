# Mind-game-Guess-the-Number-
Overview Of The Mind Game Project:



Create a python class designed to play a mind game. The procedure of the game is as follows :-



Your friend or you have to pick up an integer in the range 0 to 99. Now your program will be able to guess the number by maximum 7 trials. At each step, the system will guess an integer, the participant has to say either it is correct or smaller or bigger. Based on this input, your program will be intelligently guess another number. And so on.



The class should have proper exception handling and follow proper naming convention, comments and layout for easy readability.



Note: The game will be command line based. The program will prompt user for input and print output on the console. You can build a more sophisticated GUI if you are comfortable with building UIâ€™s in python. 



This is an example of how the game can proceed:



Sample Output: 
Computer: Hey! Please guess a number between 1 and 100. I will try to guess what you have guessed. Press enter when ready
User:<Enter>
Computer: You guessed 50. Is that correct? Write Yes or No
user: No
Computer: Is the number greater or lesser than 50? Type G for greater and L for Lesser.
User: G





Your project will be graded on:

Your approach that you will describe in detail

Your understanding and application of the basic concepts of Python 

Your presentation style - you can include a video or ppt showcasing the work that you have done

Your code and how well you have documented it including using comments and indentation



What you have to submit:

A brief description of the project

Your project code

Any ppt or video you may want to submit to showcase your work 



Hint:

Always try to eliminate 50% of possible solutions. Think binary search.
